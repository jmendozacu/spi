    <p><b>How do I place an order?</b></p>
    <p>Placing an order is simple and secure.  Just select the color, size and quantity of the item(s) you would like to purchase and then click the “Add to Bag” button. The Shopping Cart page will display the items in your cart and will allow you to change the quantity of each item you’ve selected or remove items.  From the Shopping Cart page you can either proceed to checkout or continue shopping.</p>
    <p>When you have finished shopping, click on the “View Bag” or “Checkout” icon at the top right area of the page to review your selections.  When you are satisfied with your order, click the “Proceed to Checkout” icon to complete your purchase. </p>
    <p><b>Items keep disappearing from my cart, what’s going on?</b></p>
    <p>You need to make sure that you have cookies enabled in your web browser.</p>
    <p><b>What forms of payment do you accept?</b></p>
    <p>We accept payment by Discover, Visa and MasterCard. <br/> <br/> We will charge for the processed in-stock items, plus the entire amount of shipping and handling costs.  Payment for any backordered items will be charged upon delivery.  You will not be billed any additional shipping fees for backordered items.</p>
    <p><b>Do you charge sales tax?</b></p>
    <p>It depends on the state and/or city that you live in. When you enter your shipping information the sales tax, if applicable, will be calculated automatically.</p>
    <p><b>How do I make changes to or cancel an existing order?</b></p>
    <p>Please remember that in-stock items ordered before 2:00PM ET Monday – Friday (excluding holidays) will ship the same business day!

Cancelling or changing an order usually involves return of merchandise or additional shipments. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please refer to our returns policy for additional information.</p>
    <p><b>Do I have to create an account with you?</b></p>

With an account you can also be notified about new products and promotions as soon as they are available. But, rest assured, you can also check out as a guest without creating an account with us.</p>
    <p><b>Do you store my credit card information?</b></p>
    <p>No we don’t. In fact your credit card information never passes through our servers. We use <a href="http://Authorize.net">Authorize.net</a>’s CIM to securely tokenize all credit card information. We do not store your credit card, only a token referencing with a PCI complaint tokenizer. We do not have access to the card but will store the token on your account at your request.</p>
    <p><b>What if an item is not in stock?</b></p>
    <p>On occasion, demand for a product will exceed the quantity in stock. If this is the case, you will see a message about availability when you hit the Add to Bag button.  In addition, if you order an item that is currently out of stock, we will notify you by email that the product is backordered and let you know when it is expected.  We will usually give you the option of replacing the item with a different one (i.e., a different color)<br/> <br/> If you have ordered multiple times, in-stock items will be shipped immediately via your requested shipping method so as not to delay your entire order. Backordered items will be shipped at our cost at no extra charge to you.</p>

    <p><b>What is Heartsoul made out of?</b></p>
    <p>Heartsoul products are made from 95% Polyester/5% Spandex Poplin. Our print tops are made from 94% Polyester/6% Spandex Poplin and our underscrub knit tops are made from 95% Rayon/5% Spandex knit. <br/> <br/> Our scrubs offer 4-way stretch and are moisture-wicking and wrinkle-resistant. They also include Certainty® Antimicrobial Fabric Technology*</p>
    <p><b>What is Certainty® Antimicrobial Fabric Technology*?</b></p>
    <p>Certainty uses an EPA-registered antimicrobial fabric technology to reduce, inhibit and minimize the growth of unwanted microorganisms on the fabric.* Certainty provides garments with long-lasting freshness and helps to extend the life of the garment. Garments featuring Certainty give wearers confidence that their garments look professional and maintain their fit throughout the rigors of daily work.</p>
    <p>*  Wash all garments thoroughly after each use. Garments featuring antimicrobial technology do not protect users or others against bacteria, viruses or other disease organisms. Always follow all best practices for infection prevention.</p>
