                        <p class="bold">What are cookies? How does Heartsoul use cookies on its site?</p>
                        <p>A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.</p>

                        <p>We will use cookies to collect technical information about where you are on the internet (e.g. the URL you came from, IP address, domain types like .co.uk and .com), your browser type, and the country and telephone area code where your computer is located, to keep you logged in (if you have signed into your website account) and/or to provide you with a continuous interactive website experience tailored to your region and language preferences.</p>

                        <p>We also use pixel tags to collect non-identifiable and/or pseudonymized information about how you view the Website. A pixel tag is an invisible tag placed on a website, not on your device, for tracking activity on that website. When you access those pages of the Website, pixel tags generate a notice of that visit. Pixel tags usually work in conjunction with cookies.</p>

                        <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. Your web browser's help function should tell you how to do this. Alternatively, you can find information about how to do this for all commonly used internet browsers at http://www.aboutcookies.org/default.aspx. This website will also explain how you can delete cookies which are already stored on your device. However, if you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to keep you logged into the site or recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.</p>

                        <p class="heading">Data Security</p>

                        <p>Our websites and shopping carts (including credit card information) are secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites.</p>

                        <p class="bold">Your Data Processing Rights</p>
                        <p>We take reasonable steps to help ensure that the personal information we collect from you is accurate, complete and current. You may request access to your personal information and request that erroneous or inaccurate personal information be updated. You may also request that your personal information and account be deleted. You may invoke these rights by contacting us via email at <a href="mailto:privacyhelp@strategicpartners.net">privacyhelp@strategicpartners.net</a> or telephoning us at 818-671-2100. We will respond promptly to your requests in accordance with applicable law. For your protection, we will only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the e-mail address that you use to send us your request and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We may decline to process requests that jeopardize the privacy of others, that are extremely impractical, or that would cause us to take any
                            action not permissible under applicable laws. Additionally, as permitted by applicable laws, we may need to retain certain personal information for a longer period for record-keeping purposes, such as retaining records relating to your purchases for warranty or accounting purposes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bold">How do I remove my information from email, phone and postal mailing lists?</p>
                        <p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us or our affiliated brands, please let us know at any time by either email or postal mail, or by using the "opt-out" link provided at the bottom of each promotional email. If you contact us by email or postal mail, please be sure to include your email address and full name.</p>
                        <p>In addition, if you ask us to remove your name and address from our email or postal mailing list, we will need to maintain your name in a "do not contact" file to ensure that we can honor your request.</p>

                        <p class="bold">What about links to other websites and services?</p>

                        <p>The Website may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.</p>

                        <p class="bold">Jurisdiction and Cross-Border Data Transfer</p>

                        <p>The Website is controlled and operated from the United States and is not intended to subject SPI to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than the United States. Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have offices or in which our third-party service providers reside.</p>

                        <p class="bold">Your California Privacy Rights</p>

                        <p>If you are a resident of California, you have the right under the California "Shine the Light" law (Cal. Civil Code § 1798.83) to request, by regular or electronic mail, a list of the categories of personal information that were shared by SPI with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, the names and addresses of those third parties, and if the nature of their business cannot reasonably be determined from their name, examples of the products and services marketed by them. However, as described above, except where necessary to fulfill an order from you for goods or services or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, SPI will not share your data with third parties unless you consent to such disclosure. Alternatively, you may opt out at any time from any information sharing to which you previously consented. For these reasons, SPI is not required to respond further to California customer inquiries under the
                            California Shine the Light law.</p>

                        <p class="bold">Do Not Track</p>

                        <p>You have the ability to enable "Do Not TRack" in your browser seetings. Doing this sends a signal to websites, ad networks and plug-in providers about your browsing preferences. This Website does not currently respond to the Do Not Track browser signal.</p>

                        <p>At Strategic Partners, Inc. (SPI), we are committed to maintaining a standard of excellence in every aspect of our supply chain. We continually strive to achieve the goal of ensuring that the working conditions of SPI's supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. SPI's suppliers must commit in all their activities to operate in full compliance with the local laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate.</p>

                        <p class="bold">verification</p>

                        <p>Prior to partnering with any new suppliers, and annually thereafter, we require suppliers to sign our Code of Conduct for Suppliers certifying that they do not engage in human trafficking and/or forced labor. Our process is managed by our own risk-management.</p>

                        <p class="bold">supplier audits</p>

                        <p>Each year we conduct announced and unannounced audits of each supplier to determine if they are complying with our company standards aimed at ensuring human trafficking and/or forced labor is not tainting our products. Since we began auditing our suppliers, we have found all of them to be in compliance with our standards. Our risk-management team or 3rd party audit firms conduct the audits. Audits consist of reviewing time cards, going on an extensive facility tour and conducting individual interviews with employees.</p>

                        <p class="bold">certification</p>

                        <p>As a condition of doing business with SPI all suppliers must sign SPI's Code of Conduct for Suppliers and answer specific questions certifying that: (1) No employee is less than the legal minimum working age, but in no event is less than 15 years of age; (2) That all workers are there voluntarily; (3) That all employees are free to leave once their shift ends; (4) That the lowest hourly wage is at least the minimum required by government standards; (5) That no employee works more hours in a given week than the legal maximum; and (6) That employees are given adequate time for meals during each shift. Each supplier must sign SPI's Code of Conduct for Suppliers annually and records are maintained at SPI's offices in Chatsworth, CA.</p>

                        <p class="bold">internal accountability</p>

                        <p>Non-compliance with our company standards regarding slavery and trafficking will result in termination of a business relationship with an employee or contractor.</p>

                        <p class="bold">training</p>

                        <p>Although at this time SPI does not provide employees or contractors with formal training on human trafficking and slavery, it has devoted resources to providing supply chain oversight by hiring a Director of Social Compliance and empowering its EVP of Sourcing and Procurement to take all necessary steps with SPI's suppliers.</p>

                        <p>* The above disclosures only apply to the apparel products SPI designs, manufactures and distributes. SPI does not have policies or procedures in place for the other products it manufactures and/or purchases from vendors for the purpose of distributing such products (e.g., footwear, legwear, accessories and gift-with-purchase items (GWP)). This page will be updated when such policies and procedures have been finalized.</p>
